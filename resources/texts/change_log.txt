[5.0]
<i><a href="https://youtu.be/kRj7pR4OkQA">Watch the launch event</a> to learn more about Ultimaker Cura 5.0.</i>

* New slicing engine
Following special beta releases to test the Arachne engine, we are pleased to announce our new slicing engine is here in Ultimaker Cura! This all-new engine uses variable line widths when preparing files for printing, meaning you can now print thin and intricate parts more accurately and with greater strength. 

* Renewed the Ultimaker Cura Marketplace
We have streamlined the workflow for accessing the Ultimaker Marketplace inside of Ultimaker Cura. The UI has been improved and it’s now easier and faster to find and install plugins and material profiles.

* Improved print profiles for Ultimaker printers
The new slicing engine in Ultimaker Cura 5.0 has helped us to improve our print profiles. This means that users of Ultimaker printers can achieve speed increases of up to 20%.

Look around and you will notice that we have refreshed over 100 icons throughout Ultimaker Cura. The new icons are designed for clarity – resulting in a simpler and more informative slicing experience. Also, when scaling the Ultimaker Cura window, the UI will adapt, resulting in less visual clutter.

*<i>From version 4.11 onwards - Ultimaker Cura is only supported on operating systems actively maintained by their software manufacturer or community. This means Windows 7 and MacOS 10.13 will no longer be supported. Technically this means Ultimaker will stop testing and developing for such operating systems. However, even though it is no longer supported, there is still a high likelihood the application keeps functioning.</i>
