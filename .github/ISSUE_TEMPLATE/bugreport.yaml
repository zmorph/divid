      Please be sure to add the following files:
        * For slicing issues, upload a **project file** that clearly shows the bug. 
          To save a project file go to `File -> Save project`. Please make sure to .zip your project file. For big files you may need to use WeTransfer or similar file sharing sites. 
          G-code files are not project files!
        * **Screenshots** of showing the problem, perhaps before/after images.
        * A **log file** for crashes and similar issues.
          You can find your log file here:
          Windows: `%APPDATA%\cura\<Cura version>\cura.log` or usually `C:\Users\\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\cura\<Cura version>\cura.log`
          MacOS: `$USER/Library/Application Support/cura/<Cura version>/cura.log`
          Ubuntu/Linux: `$USER/.local/share/cura/<Cura version>/cura.log` 
          
          If the Cura user interface still starts, you can also reach this directory from the application menu in Help -> Show settings folder
